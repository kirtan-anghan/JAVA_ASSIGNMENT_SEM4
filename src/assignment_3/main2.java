//â€¢	Write a Program in which the area of room is calculated and the cost of white wash is also evaluated.
// Further, include the provision for window on any type of the walls.
// The input regarding the parameters including length, breadth and height of the room are taken through command line.
// If there is a window, then its parameter including length and breadth are also taken through command line.
// If these input parameters are below 1, then raise an exception; otherwise calculate the area and cost and display the result.
// (note that in order to calculate the area of the room to be painted the area of window must be deducted from the total of the room.)
